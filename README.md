#  ðŸ”„ react-native-tsx

Convert your React Native project from JavaScript to Typescript using default settings.

## What's inside?

A simple command line tool that allows you to run your React Native project as a Typescript project.

## What's NOT inside?

A few minutes of manual labor defining types and conforming to Typescript protocols after `react-native-tsx` converts all your `js` and `jsx` files to Typescript.

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install -g react-native-tsx` to globally install this command line tool.
2. Navigate to your project's directory.
3. Run `react-native-tsx`.
